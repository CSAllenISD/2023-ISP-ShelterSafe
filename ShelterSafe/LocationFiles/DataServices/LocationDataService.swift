            description: "There are several reasons why building a high school stadium costing 50 million dollars can be considered a waste of money. Firstly, the cost of such a facility is significantly higher than what is necessary for high school sports events. With 50 million dollars, a school district could invest in improving academic programs, building new classrooms, or even hiring more teachers, all of which could have a more direct impact on student success. Additionally, maintaining such a large facility can also be expensive and divert resources from other important areas. Furthermore, high school stadiums are often used infrequently, which makes it difficult to justify the large investment. The limited use of the facility may mean that the stadium will not generate enough revenue to offset the costs, leading to long-term financial strain on the school district. Additionally, a stadium that is underutilized may also be a potential safety hazard, as it could become a target for vandalism or criminal activity. In conclusion, while building a high school stadium can seem like a good idea for promoting school spirit and athletics, it may not be the best use of funds for a school district. With limited financial resources, it is important to prioritize investments that have a direct impact on student learning and success.",
